# Dictionary Key Aggregator

This Python program takes two dictionaries as input, identifies their common keys, and aggregates the values associated with those keys into a set. The result is a new dictionary where each common key maps to a set containing the values from both input dictionaries. 

## Example Input
```python
dict_1 = {"first": 2, "second": 4, "third": 8}
dict_2 = {"second": 16, "fifth": 1, "third": 6}
```

## Execution
When you run the program, it processes the input dictionaries to find mutual keys and aggregate their values.

### Code
```python
# Define the input dictionaries
dict_1 = {"first": 2, "second": 4, "third": 8}
dict_2 = {"second": 16, "fifth": 1, "third": 6}

# Get the intersection of keys
mutual_keys = set(dict_1.keys()) & set(dict_2.keys())

# Create a new dictionary with sets of values
mixture_dict = {key: {dict_1[key], dict_2[key]} for key in mutual_keys}

# Print the result
print(mixture_dict)
```

## Result
Running the above code will output:
```
{'second': {16, 4}, 'third': {8, 6}}
```

### Explanation
- The common keys between `dict_1` and `dict_2` are `"second"` and `"third"`.
- The values for `"second"` are `4` (from `dict_1`) and `16` (from `dict_2`), resulting in the set `{4, 16}`.
- The values for `"third"` are `8` (from `dict_1`) and `6` (from `dict_2`), resulting in the set `{8, 6}`.

### Conclusion
This program is useful for situations where you need to merge values from two dictionaries while focusing only on the keys that exist in both. The use of sets ensures that each value is unique, allowing for easy aggregation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12

## Usage
To run the program, simply copy the code into a Python environment and execute it. You can modify the input dictionaries as needed to test with different values.
